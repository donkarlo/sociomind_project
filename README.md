# Berifly
A Python toolkit for novelty detection in multi-robot sensory data and for grounding symbolic, natural-language-like
communication to reduce free-energy surprise and improve collective survival.

# workflow
This Python package investigates whether communication through a grounded, natural-language-like system can improve the survival of multi-robot groups by reducing their free-energy surprise rate.
It provides tools for novelty detection in spatio-temporal sensory streams using models such as Dynamic Bayesian
Networks (DBNs), LSTMs, and attention-based Transformers.
Building on detected novelties, the package supports grounding a symbolic language composed of alphabet-level units and
word-sequence structures, with the aim of enabling robots to minimize surprise more effectively and thus increase
group-level survival chances.
